#Compact Component Library: CoCo#

A C++ framework for high-performance multi-thread shared memory applications.
Split your application in component that can run in parallel to each other or be encapsulated one in the other.
Components can run periodically or be triggered by events. 
CoCo provides also a port system allowing the components to communicate with very low overhead without worrying of concurrency issues.

This framework has been developed in the Percro Laboratory of the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa by Filippo Brizzi and Emanuele Ruffaldi.

It has been widely used in robotics applications, ranging from Augmented Reality for teleoperation to haptic-rendering for virtual training. 

It is also compatible with ROS allowing it to be used in any kind of high-level control applications.
